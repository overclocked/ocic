Welcome. This is an experimental attempt at a simpler approach to large project
build frameworks for C applications and librares. It may also become the actual
library of utility data structures and everyday reusable app functionality. The
current list of functionality is:

 * cmd-line-yn - The basic proof of concept for the library, a yN with prompt.
 * singly-linked-list - Useful for short, one-way lists and job interviews.
 * sorted-list - Doubly linked, sorted list.

Overclocked Development Environment, tldr:

  mkdir env
  cd env
  git clone https://github.com/overclocked/ocic.git
  cd ocic
  make

Now you should have the ocic library, ready to link.

FAQ:

Q: What is this?

A: ocic is a general purpose library of fundamental code that rely on nothing
   but standard C, and which might be useful for application development. Or,
   more realistically, that's what it could be. For now it is a proof of concept
   in developing best practices for a simple-but-flexible build environment.

Q: Where are you going with this?

A: The desire is to simply add functionality as needed, and refine performance
   also as needed. The main thing is: it should work.

Q: What are the principles beind ocic?

A: Simplicity, readability, correctness, reasonable efficiency. But this is not
   designed for hardcore performance. Rather, a "good enough and let the
   compiler do its best" kind of performance.

Q: Who is involved?

A: At this time, Overclocked is a one-person team. Bluejack.

Q: Could I get involved?

A: If you are inspired, reach out to bluejack.

Q: What does 'ocic' mean?

A: OC = OverClocked. IC = "I see". It kind of sounds good.
   Hopefully, you *will* see!
